1. Use Eclipse or Net bean platform and acquaint with the various menus. Create a test project, add 
a test class, and run it. See how you can use auto suggestions, auto fill. Try code formatter and 
code refactoring like renaming variables, methods, and classes. Try debug step by step with a 
small program of about 10 to 15 lines which contains at least one if else condition and a for loop. 

//Program to print even and odd numbers in first 10 natural numbers



public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 10;
        for(int i = 1;i<=10;i++){
            if(i%2==0){
                System.out.println(i+" even");
            }
            else{
                System.out.println(i+" odd");
            }
        }
    }
}
Output:
1 odd
2 even
3 odd
4 even
5 odd
6 even
7 odd
8 even
9 odd
