8. Write a Java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains two integers and an empty method named print Area ().
Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape.
Each one of the classes contains only the method print Area () that prints the area of the given shape.

import java.util.Scanner;
import java.io.*;
abstract class Shape{
    public int a;
    public int b;
    abstract void printArea(int a, int b);	}
class Rectangle extends Shape{
    void printArea(int a,int b){
        System.out.println("Area of rectangle of length "+a+" breadth "+b+" is "+(a*b)+" units");	 } }
class Triangle extends Shape{
    void printArea(int a,int b){
        System.out.println("Area of triangle of height "+a+" base "+b+" is "+(0.5*a*b)+" units");	} }
class Circle extends Shape{
    void printArea(int a,int b){
        System.out.println("Area of circle of radius "+a+" is "+(3.14*a*a)+" units");	}	}
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
        Triangle t = new Triangle();
        Circle c = new Circle();
        r.printArea(4,3);
        t.printArea(7,5);
        c.printArea(4,0);
    }	}
Output:
Area of rectangle of length 4 breadth 3 is 12 units
Area of triangle of height 7 base 5 is 17.5 units
Area of circle of radius 4 is 50.24 units
